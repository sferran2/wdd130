                <p> My name is Silvia Ferran. Iâ€™m from Colombia, and I live in the Orlando, Florida area. My family and I love going to Disney togetherâ€”especially with my daughter, who is 7 years old. She loves swimming and has Down syndrome. I'm excited to learn more about web development in this class! I hope everyone has a great semester, and that we can support each other as we learn!. </p>
