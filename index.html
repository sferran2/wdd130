                <p> My name is Silvia Ferran, and Iâ€™m originally from Colombia. I currently live in the Orlando, Florida area with my family. We love spending time together at Disneyâ€”especially with my 7-year-old daughter, who brings so much joy to every trip. She has Down syndrome and adores swimming and singing karaoke. I hold a bachelor's degree in Economics, but Iâ€™m now pursuing an entirely new field: programming. I'm genuinely excited about this journey, and so far, Iâ€™ve discovered a particular passion for web design. However, I know I still have a long way to go before I can confidently identify my ultimate career focus. Each day brings new challenges and learning opportunities, and Iâ€™m eager to continue exploring and growing along the way. </p>

                <p> Colombia is an incredible country with so much to offer. From the vibrant culture to the stunning landscapes, itâ€™s a place that captivates anyone who visits. The warm, welcoming people make it even more special, reflecting the countryâ€™s rich history and diverse traditions.
